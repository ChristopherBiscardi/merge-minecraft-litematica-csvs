# merge-minecraft-litematica-csvs
A Let's Code! project that explores deserializing data from CSVs and merging them. The project is based around merging data from a Minecraft client mod called Litematica.

Follow along as we deserialize structs from CSV files and merge them in Rust. We take advantage of serde and the csv crate and dive into the Entry API and interesting applications of collect().
